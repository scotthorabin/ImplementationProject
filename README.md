This was the design, implementation and testing for my dissertation project

The main hyposis for this project was toâ€‹ examine the effectiveness of gamification in educational materials for undergraduate computing students, especially regarding enhancing their understanding of complicated computing concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
With earlier research indicating that learning computer programming is difficult and may lead to high dropout rate (Dirzyte et al, 2023), this project aims to investigate if developing engaging and interactive materials using gamification will improve students understanding and retention of the topics and the degree overall. 

Using design software such as Figma, Miro to design the websites layout and features. The project provided essential features to ensure the aims where met.

Implementing the project using Visual Studio .NET Razor Pages and SQL Management, quizzes were created and stored for users to complete alongside users data in order to retrieve achievments
